The Incas believed Viracocha created Everything. They Belevived that he made the Sun and moon by taking them from a lake. Inti was the god of the sun. It was said that the Emperor was the "Son of the Sun" as he was a dirct disendant from Inti. The largest Event of the year is Raymi festival, when the Inca put on their best clothes and lined up in terms of class. Then they had a multi-day celibration for their creator, Viracocha.
   
   Illapa was the god of rain, thunder and war. The head priest was the uma uillaca. Under him (no im not being sextist, he was always a he) was the hatun uillcas or the administrative priests. The local Priest were called yana uillacas. The jobs of the priest were to teach locals about Inca relgoin, hear confessions, and to give penance to those who have sinned.
