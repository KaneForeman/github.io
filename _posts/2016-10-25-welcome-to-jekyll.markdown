  Machu Picchu is a 15th century Inca village. I was discovered in 1911 by Governer Hiram Bingham before his career as a politician. Its is beleave to be the palace for the emperor of the Inca. Muchu Picchu was built atop a mount Huayna Picchu in Cusco Region, Urubamba, Peru. its is a sires of house made out of stone that ahve been worn down over time.it has the genaric stone walls found at most all Inca ruins. Though it was biult over 450 years ago, it has shifted less then a milimeter.
  
  Officialy called Historic Sanctuary of Machu Picchu, Machu Picchu was Built in the year 1450 AD but was abandon over 100 years later in 1572. This was caused by spainish conquest which brought smallpox and war. This drove the Inca out of Machu Piccu. One of the most remarkable things in machu picchu is the temple of the sun, which was mostly still standing after 400 years of being dorment.
